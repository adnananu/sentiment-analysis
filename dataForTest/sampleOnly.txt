Yes, this movie is a real thief. It stole some shiny Oscars from Avatar just because politicians wanted another war-hero movie to boost the acceptance (support?) for the wars U.S. is still fighting today. I do not really want to go here into politics, but come on, this is more clear than the summer sky. Hurt locker does not really have anything outstanding, no real plot at all. I really feel myself in the 50's of Hungary. Even if we consider this title a reasonable piece of the "U.S. wars are cool" genre, you surely have much better movies to choose from. <br /><br />It is slick & well produced, so it might last a while yet.  :D I was expecting a little something from "K-911" That's my whole $1.00 on this film. On 'Max Power's Scale of 1 to 10' I rate this movie: 1. PS I would like to correct Corinthian's review. The Cat In The Hat * out of *****. who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years prior that his penis is too big? I gave this loooooooooooong film a "2" because of the attractive actors and semi-sexy love scenes.while Mariel would soon receive an Oscar nomination for Woody Allen’s MANHATTAN (1979). so i will go on.... (ctrl+c, ctrl+v) :))) This is one of the most inert movies ever made  so inert. The only mystery here is how Oscar®. they will rule us? Hmmm Yup ..hello. Taken from the play by US' born Thornton Wilder in the future of the developing country of the USA. I love " The Da Vinci Code! Love luv lubb the Da Vinci Code! I'm not a big fan of love kirsten / leah / kate escapades i've ever read... ' The Da Vinci Code'it was AWESOME.")
